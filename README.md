## 🛠️ Customization

1. Log in to the admin panel at `admin.php` to update your personal information
2. Select your preferred theme from the theme dropdown in the admin panel
3. Preview how different themes look using the live preview feature
4. Modify the CSS in `css/style.css` or theme files to change the appearance
5. Update the print styles in `css/print.css` if needed
6. Replace placeholder images with your own project screenshots and profile photo

## 🎨 Theme System

### Selecting a Theme
1. Log in to the admin panel
2. Navigate to the theme selection dropdown
3. Choose from the available themes
4. Use the live preview to see how elements will look with the selected theme
5. Save your changes to apply the theme to your entire website

### Creating Custom Themes
You can create your own custom themes:

1. Duplicate one of the existing theme CSS files in the `css/` directory
2. Rename it to `theme-yourthemename.css`
3. Modify the CSS variables and styles to create your unique look
4. Add your theme name to the available themes list in `header.php`
5. Add your theme as an option in the theme dropdown in `admin.php`

### Theme Structure
Each theme uses CSS variables to define colors, fonts, and other design elements:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #value;
    --secondary-color: #value;
    --accent-color: #value;
    --text-color: #value;
    --light-bg: #value;
    /* Additional variables */
}
```

### Theme Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with themes:

1. Ensure the `theme` column exists in your database by running `update_db.php`
2. Verify theme values with `check_theme.php` - this will set default themes if missing
3. Check that all theme CSS files are properly loaded in `header.php`
4. Make sure each theme CSS file defines all required CSS variables

### Theme Preview
The admin panel includes a live theme preview section that shows:
- Button styling
- Card components
- Progress bars
- Text formatting

This helps you visualize how each theme will affect different UI elements before applying it.

## 🖨️ Printing and PDF Export

### Printing
The portfolio includes a print button that allows visitors to print your resume. The print.css file ensures that the printed version is optimized for paper.

### PDF Export
The site offers PDF resume generation using wkhtmltopdf, which ensures the exported PDF looks exactly like the web version with print styles applied:

1. Click the "Download Resume" button to generate a PDF
2. The PDF generation script creates a temporary HTML file with all your resume content
3. wkhtmltopdf renders this HTML with print.css applied
4. The resulting PDF is delivered to the user for download

#### Requirements for PDF Export
- wkhtmltopdf must be installed on the server
- See [wkhtmltopdf-setup.md](wkhtmltopdf-setup.md) for installation instructions

## 📋 Requirements

- Web server with PHP support (7.0 or higher)
- PDO SQLite extension enabled
- File write permissions for the `data` directory
- wkhtmltopdf (for PDF export functionality)
- Modern web browser

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

**Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose

1. **Quick Start**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakersh/prakersh.in.git
   cd prakersh.in
   ./build.sh build && ./build.sh run
   ```

2. **Access**:
   - Website: http://localhost:8080
   - Admin: http://localhost:8080/admin.php (admin/admin123)

3. **Management Commands**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh help        # Show all commands
   ./build.sh dev         # Development mode with live reload
   ./build.sh logs        # View application logs
   ./build.sh status      # Check container status
   ./build.sh stop        # Stop the application
   ```

For detailed Docker instructions, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

### Traditional Deployment

#### Deploying to a Fresh Server

1. **Server Requirements**:
   - PHP 7.0 or higher
   - PDO SQLite extension
   - Write permissions for web server user
   - wkhtmltopdf (for PDF generation)

2. **Set Up Process**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/prakersh/prakersh.in.git
   cd prakersh.in
   
   # Ensure data directory exists and is writable
   mkdir -p data
   chmod 755 data
   
   # Set proper permissions for web files
   chmod -R 755 .
   chmod 644 *.php *.md *.json
   ```

3. **Database Initialization**:
   - Navigate to `http://your-server/init_db.php` in a browser
   - This will create and populate the SQLite database

4. **Admin Access**:
   - Navigate to `http://your-server/admin.php`
   - Log in with default credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`
   - Immediately change the default password in the Settings tab

5. **Production Security**:
   - Consider setting up HTTPS for secure communication
   - Restrict direct access to the database file with .htaccess
   - Add IP restrictions for admin access if applicable

### Shared Hosting Deployment

For shared hosting environments:

1. Upload all files via FTP to your web hosting
2. Ensure PHP 7.0+ is available and SQLite is enabled
3. Set proper permissions:
   - Directories: 755
   - PHP files: 644
   - data directory: 755
4. Follow steps 3-5 from the section above

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline:

- Automatically tests PHP code for syntax errors
- Verifies code quality with PSR-12 standards
- Lints CSS and JavaScript files
- Runs integration tests by starting a PHP server and checking responses with wget
- Creates a downloadable build artifact on successful code checks

For more details, see the [CI/CD documentation](CICD.md).

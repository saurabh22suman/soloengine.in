# Troubleshooting Gateway Timeout Issues with Dokploy

If you experience gateway timeout errors when deploying with Dokploy, try the following solutions:

## Common Causes of Gateway Timeouts

1. **PHP Execution Time Limits**
   - Default PHP max_execution_time may be too low
   - Some operations (especially PDF generation) may exceed the limit

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - Connection between Traefik and the PHP container may be unstable
   - Network latency within the Docker environment

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Insufficient CPU or memory allocation
   - Container resource limits may be too restrictive

## Solutions Implemented in This Configuration

1. **Increased PHP Timeouts**
   - PHP max_execution_time increased to 120 seconds
   - FPM request_terminate_timeout set to 120 seconds
   - Traefik timeouts configured via Dokploy labels

2. **PHP-FPM Optimization**
   - Increased max children and server processes
   - Adjusted buffer sizes for better performance
   - Implemented dynamic process management

3. **Added Health Checks**
   - Implemented health.php endpoint for service monitoring
   - Added Docker healthcheck configuration
   - Enabled Dokploy service monitoring

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error reporting for timeout diagnosis
   - Database connection monitoring
   - Service status reporting

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If you still experience gateway timeout errors:

1. **Check Dokploy Logs**
   ```bash
   dokploy logs web
   ```

2. **Inspect Traefik Logs**
   ```bash
   dokploy logs traefik
   ```

3. **Test PHP Directly**
   ```bash
   dokploy exec web php -v
   ```

4. **Check Health Endpoint**
   ```
   https://me.soloengine.in/health.php
   ```

5. **Adjust Timeouts Further**
   - Edit the PHP container environment variables in docker-compose.yml
   - Increase dokploy.timeout label value if needed

6. **Review Resource Allocation**
   - Check if your Dokploy host has sufficient resources
   - Consider adding resource limits to services in docker-compose.yml
